## Welcome to ipcoal
*ipcoal* is a package for simulating and analyzing genealogies and 
sequences across genomes, with a focus on phylogenetic-scale analyses. 
*ipcoal* builds upon the powerful coalescent simulator *msprime*, but provides
a different syntax and workflow for describing and visualizing complex 
demographic models (e.g., divergence times, effective population sizes, migration events),
calling simulation functions, and summarizing or analyzing results. 
*ipcoal* includes many methods for downstream analysis of coalescent simulations,
such as calculating likelihoods under the Kingman coalescent, multispecies 
coalescent, and sequentially Markov coalescent models, as well as implementing
phylogenetic inference software on simulated sequences.

The *ipcoal* package is designed for use in jupyter-notebooks to encourage 
reproducible and shareable results. It is a powerful tool for posterior 
predictive data analysis, methods validation, for generating training data for
machine learning, and as a teaching tool for learning the coalescent process 
in an interactive and visual environment.

## Our goals
- Accessible: Easy to install and easy to use, with documentation and cookbooks.
- Reproducible: Designed for interactive use in Jupyter notebooks.
- Reliable: Tested on each build.
- Comprehensible: We provide simple methods to verify and visualize models.
- Didactic: We provide exercises for teaching in a classroom.
- Transparent: Read our code and make it your own.
